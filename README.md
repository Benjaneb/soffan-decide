# soffan-decide

### DD2480: Assignment 1
This project implements the DECIDE() function as part of a hypothetical anti-ballistic missile defense system. The function evaluates radar tracking data to determine whether an interceptor launch should be authorized at the moment it is called. DECIDE() computes a set of Launch Interceptor Conditions (LICs), combines them using a Logical Connector Matrix and several intermediate vectors and matrices, and ultimately produces a launch-unlock decision. An interceptor is authorized to launch if and only if all required conditions specified by the final unlocking logic are satisfied.
